  In order to provide benchmarking within YARDoc
  A developer uses DSL

  Scenario: ☎ is the method to create new instance of a class with suggested params if needed
    Given I have a class with contructor requiring parameters
    When I call a ☎ method on it
    Then I have an instance of the class

  Scenario: ☏ is the method to be called on an instance of the class with suggested params if needed
    Given I have an instance method of the class requiring parameters
    When I call a ☏ method for it
    Then I have params suggested and the method called

  Scenario: The benchmarks set are to be processed with call to ::Kernel::⌛ method
    Given I marked some methods as benchmarkable
    When I call a ⌛ method
    Then I yield all the benchmarks

  Scenario: The benchmarks may be set with wildcards
    Given I marked all methods of a class as benchmarkable via `:⋅`
    When I call a ⌛ method
    Then I yield all the benchmarks
    
  Scenario: The only benchmark is to be returned properly for the class’ method
    Given I marked all methods of a class as benchmarkable via `:⋅`
    When I call a get method with `BmTests::BmTester`, `do_it` parameters
    Then I yield all the benchmarks
